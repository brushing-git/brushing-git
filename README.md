# About Me

I am an academically trained philosopher of science and data scientist.  I do work in machine learning interpretability research, statistical modeling, and data science.

Some of my highlight projects include:

- Using statistical methods to compare the concepts used by deep learning algorithms with each other and limitations of those methods.
- Fitting data sets to probability distributions and then running statistical tests to evaluate hypotheses.
- Performing supervised learning using linear classifiers and artificial neural networks to make predictions about hospital readmissions.
