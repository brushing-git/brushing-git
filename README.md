# About Me

I am an academically trained philosopher of science and data scientist.  I do work in machine learning interpretability research, statistical modeling, and data science.

Some of my highlight projects include:

- Using statistical methods to compare the [concepts used by deep learning algorithms](https://github.com/brushing-git/RSAProject) with each other and limitations of those methods.
- Fitting data sets to probability distributions and then running [statistical tests to evaluate hypotheses](https://github.com/brushing-git/Fitting-Distributions-Project).
- Performing supervised learning using linear classifiers and artificial neural networks to make [predictions about hospital readmissions](https://github.com/brushing-git/Hospital-Readmissions-Project).
- Analyzing the [VC dimension of Mixture of Experts models](https://github.com/brushing-git/PeirceMachine) in the context of why they perform better than Bayesian Model Averages

I also have a published paper on the [No Free Lunch Theorems](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-022-03901-w) and ongoing work on the history and philosophy of probability theory with the work of Frank Ramsey.
